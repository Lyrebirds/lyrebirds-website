		"HERO": "About us?",
		"SUBTITLE": "under text",
		"INTRO-1": "Lyrebirds was founded by three software engineers, with different industry experiences. Our motivation for starting Lyrebirds, came from first hand experience, with how insufficient the security is, in many important IT-systems. We have seen how great IT-systems can really make a difference when embraced by companies and their customers. But in order to maintain the trust in technology, the technology must be trustworthy.",
		"INTRO-2": "Security can be a difficult task, and sometimes new technological errors are discovered which endangers even the most vigilant defenses. However, breaches and leaks are just as frequently caused by lack of proper security maintenance. We believe that we can support your company's trust in technology, freeing you to focus on your business."

			"CABLEHAUNT_VULNERABILITY": {
				"URL": "cable-haunt-vulnerablitiy",
				"TITLE": "Worldwide Critical Security Vulnerability in Cable Modems",
				"BODY1": [
					"Lyrebirds have today released a new security vulnerablitity by the name \"Cable Haunt\"."
				],
				"BODY2": [
					"Cable Haunt is a critical security vulnerability found in cable modems from many different manufacturers around the world. Your modem manages your Internet connection and all traffic flowing to and from all devices on your network. The security vulnerability allows a hacker to gain full control of the cable modem, which can be used to intercept private messages and redirect Internet traffic without the user's knowledge. ",
					"The security vulnerability is only available on your local network, but can be accessed from the outside due to websocket protocol handling errors. Through specially designed packages sent to your modem, an outside person can gain full control over it. Further technical details can be found at <a href = 'https://cablehaunt.com' target='_ blank'> Cable Haunt Website </a>. ",
					"Lyrebirds has partnered with Danish and foreign ISPs, as well as the Center for Cyber ​​Security, in recent months to correct the error before release. We have received insurance from both TDC (Denmark), Stofa (Denmark), Get A/S (Norway) and Telia (Norway) that all their modems have been rolling out an update that fixes the error, which means that if you live in Denmark and have had your equipment delivered from either TDC or Stofa you are already secured. not seen any evidence that the error has been exploited. ",
					"However, if you suspect that your modem has been attacked, we recommend that you read the <a href='https://cablehaunt.com' target='_blank'>Cable Haunt website</a> and make sure your equipment is up to date, then consider whether your previously unencrypted Internet traffic contained confidential information, such as passwords or personal emails, and take the necessary precautions. ",
					"Lyrebirds are very positive about the cooperation and the seriousness we have been met by those responsible.",
					"More references to the security vulnerability can be found here:"

			"BROADCOM_HTTPD_ERROR": {
				"URL": "broadcom-httpd-error",
				"TITLE": "Broadcom Cable Modem HTTPD Error",
				"BODY": [
					"A vulnerability exists that allows an attacker with existing access to the local network to initiate a denial of service attack against the local modem. The error lies in the Broadcom reference code and therefore exists on all cable modems using the Broadcom chipset, which includes the vast majority of cable modems in the world. Broadcom has not yet officially commented on the vulnerability, and we do therefore not know what the strategy for a solution is.",
					"The error lies in the handling of the WebSocket GET upgrade requests that are sent to the internal mongoose HTTPD server on the modem. If a device on the network sends a malformed upgrade request to the modem, the modem encounters a null pointer dereferencing and crashing. This can happen in 2 scenarios:",
					"<ul><li>If the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header or only one of the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key1' and 'Sec-WebSocket-Key2' headers are set when the 'Sec-WebSocket-Version' header requires both.</li><li>If both or one of the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key1' and 'Sec-WebSocket-Key2' headers are set when the 'Sec-WebSocket-Version' header only requires the 'Sec-WebSocket-Key' header.</li></ul>",
					"A video explaining the problem with the assembly code in detail can be found <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NeJyWByXNI0' target='_blank'>here</a>.",
					"We have only been able to confirm that the error exists on spectrum analyzer endpoint in the modem, but it is possible that the modem hosts similar endpoints with the same error. Assuming the error is only found on the spectrum analyzer, the solution/mitigation of the error is very similar to what we see in <a href='https://cablehaunt.com' target='_blank'>Cable Haunt</a>.",
					"The error requires control over a device on the network and cannot be exploited through eg people's browsers, as the required GET requests are restricted by CORS. Furthermore, the headers in question are automatically set by most clients, such as browsers and code libraries, and custom socket control of a local device is therefore usually needed. However, the request can be sent with eg curl as follows:",
					"<code>curl -i -s -k -H $'Connection: Upgrade' -H $'Upgrade: websocket' -H $'Sec-WebSocket-Key: g+jhLrqMeJso0clv8s/qIg==' $'http://192.168.100.1:8080/Frontend'</code>",
					"As Technicolor is in direct cooperation with Broadcom, they have initiated the repair process directly through their channels. We assisted Technicolor's internal security staff with a deeper understanding of the error, as we also encountered it during our work with Cable Haunt.",
					"The vulnerability is publicly disclosed here and is registered as <a href='https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7223' target='_blank'>CVE-2020-7223</a>."
