	"ABOUT": {
		"HERO": "Who are we?",
		"INTRO-1": "Lyrebirds was founded by three software engineers, with different industry experiences. Our motivation for starting Lyrebirds, came from first hand experience, with how insufficient the security is, in many important IT-systems. We have seen how great IT-systems can really make a difference when embraced by companies and their customers. But in order to maintain the trust in technology, the technology must be trustworthy.",
		"INTRO-2": "Security can be a difficult task, and sometimes new technological errors are discovered which endangers even the most vigilant defenses. However, breaches and leaks are just as frequently caused by lack of proper security maintenance. We believe that we can support your company's trust in technology, freeing you to focus on your business."
